# SelfProjects

Self created projects made using the skills and concepts i learn.

## Covid-19 Prediction
The first machine learning project i made using a real world dataset.
I used polynomial regression to predict the number of cases for next 7 days.
The souce of the information is given in a text file in the project folder.

The project is also updated with new .ipynb file, containing :
- Comparision of the predicted data and actual data with a graph
- The net r-squared value showing the model's efficieny
- Some extra features

## Red Wine Quality
Originally i meant to solve this as a KNN problem, but it wasn't giving good accuracy.
I have now solved it with 'random forest regression.
I tried to apply feature selection to this, but it didn't end up giving good results.
<p>The model is giving an overall accuracy of 73.75%.
I have included a confusion matrix for a more detailed insight into the results.

## Menu Driven Program
A mini-project i made using basic python concepts :
- Functions
- Object Oriented Programming
- File Handling
<p>It is a program that program stores user information(name, roll number and address) in a text file.
The user can add, update, search or delete the records present.
