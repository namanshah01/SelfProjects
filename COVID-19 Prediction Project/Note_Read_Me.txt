I have created a polynomial regression plot with one variable,
related to cases of India.

The data was from 30th Jan 2020 to 7th May 2020.
Predictions of the next week, ie 8th May 2020 to 14th May 2020 are made.

I may upload a modified version of this file next week,
to compare the results of the predictions, in a graphical format.

I have uploaded the .csv and I'll also share the link of the source :
