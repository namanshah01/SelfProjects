I have created a polynomial regression plot with one variable,
related to cases of India.

The data was from 30th Jan 2020 to 7th May 2020.
Predictions of the next week, ie 8th May 2020 to 14th May 2020 are made.

I have uploaded a modified version of the .ipynb file containing the comparision
of the predictions and the actual values in a graphical format.
I have also put 'r-squared' value to show the models accuracy.

I have uploaded the .csv and I'll also share the link of the source :
